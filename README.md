# chrome-ext-slovnikcz

This is a very simple chrome extension to translate a selected word using the http://www.slovnik.cz/ site.

It pops up a modal window with translation from http://www.slovnik.cz/
to get rid of it just click the mouse or press escape.

**It supports only english to czech translation at the moment**
